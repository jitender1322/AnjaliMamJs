step number one => environment for javascript - using of node we can execute and run js files
                   which is provide npm and npx

=> npm : node pacakge manager - using of npm we can install package
=> npx : node pacakge executer - using of npx we can execute package


-------------------------------------


LTS : long term support

need to check version of node js 

node -v

npm -v 

-------------------------------------

for react installation : 

npm install create-react-app

or

npm install -g create-react-app

-------------------------------------

for project creation (traditional method)

npx create-react-app <projectname>

cd projectname

npm start

-------------------------------------

latest react project creation

npm create vite
or
npm create vite@latest

cd projectname

npm install

npm run dev

-------------------------------------

Create React App (CRA) has long been the go-to tool for most
developer to scaffold React projects and set up a dev server.
it offers a mordern build setup with no configuration.

vite is a next-generation, front-end tool that focuses on speed
and performance.

it consists of two major part

1) A Developer Server
2) A build command

-------------------------------------

SWC : SWC(Speedy Web Compiler)

-------------------------------------

index.html
     |
main.jsx
     |
     App.jsx
     |
     Rest of the component

-------------------------------------

State : state is behaviour of component
        it is mutable property (we can change it)
        for exp. car - color - black   at purchase
                 car - color - white   at delivery

                 here we are changing state of car color

-------------------------------------

There are two types of components

1) function component : esay to understand

2) Class component : it is complex to use - it is inherited by component Class
                     
                     class components have render() method which return jsx

                     in function component there is direct return method

-------------------------------------

Spread Operator : to combine multiple array in one array
                  its called spread operator which is denoted by ... (dot operator or spread operator)

-------------------------------------

props : property of component
        
        using of props we can transfer data parent component to child component

        props are immutable ( we can't change it value)

        <childComponent key="value">

-------------------------------------

Routing : in simple language we can say navigation between one component to another component but as we know that
          react js create single page application.

          it just replace component insted of navigate

          to manage Routing in react js there is one library its called react-router-dom before use routing 
          we have to add this dependency in project.

          # npm i react-router-dom

--------------------------------------

useNavigate() : useNavigate() is one of the most popular hook which is used to create dynamic navigation
                in single page application.

                which is provided by react-router-dom

                in simple programatically we can control navigation between component.

navigate(-1) : backward one step back
navigate(1)  : forward one step next

---------------------------------------

useLoation() : useLoation is one of the best hook provided by react-router-dom. Which is used to handle browser path
               location. We can access browser path, search name (?name="aaa"), hash(#section), state.

               using of useLoation object we can access below things

               location.pathname
               location.search
               location.hash
               location.state
