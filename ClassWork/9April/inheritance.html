        inheritance : one class derived prperties of another class its called inheritance.

        using of inheritance we can reduce our code.

        inheritance provide reusability.

        using of inheritance we can save our time.

        inheritance only possible with extends keyword.

        1) parent class / base class / super class 
                    |  
                    V

        2) child class / derived class / sub class

            here child class can access prperties of parent class.

    always create object of child (derived) class.

        ===>> constructor overriding : when parent and child have same constructor
                it will override constructor.

                this() : refer correct class propertise
                super() : using of super keyword we can access specific parent's properties
     -->
    <script>
        class parent {
            constructor() {
                console.log("this is parent class");
            }
        }

        class child extends parent {
            constructor(name, subject) {
                super(name);
                this.subject = subject;
                console.log("this is child class");
            }
            display() {
                console.log("subject display :", this.subject);
            }
        }

        //object creation

        let obj = new child('tanu', 'mern');
        obj.display()
