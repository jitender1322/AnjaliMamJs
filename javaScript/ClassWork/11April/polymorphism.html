        polymorphism : poly means many and morphism means forms

            polymorphism is derived from greek word

            which means one named method has different different forms
            
        eg. addEventListener

            woman 
                |- wife
                |- mother
                |- child
            
            there are 2 types of polymorphism

            1) method overloading :

                one class have same name method with different arguments

                e.g.  class student
                {
                    dispaly(){

                    }

                    display(int id){

                    }
                }
                note : javascript does not support method overloading concept
            
            2) method overriding

                when parent and child both have same name mthod its called mthod overriding
                
     -->

    <script>
        class parent {
            display() {
                console.log("hello parent class is here");
            }
        }
        class child extends parent {
            display() {
                super.display();
                console.log("heelo child class display method is here");
            }
        }

        let obj = new child();
        obj.display();
    </script>
</body>
